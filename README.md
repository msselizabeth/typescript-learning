# TypeScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my TypeScript Learning Repository! ðŸš€
This repository is my personal playground for learning and practicing TypeScript. Here, I worked on using various data types, solving simple tasks, rewriting code for better understanding, and experimenting with TypeScript in React. This repository is as a showcase of my learning journey and commitment to improving as a developer.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

**Core TypeScript Practice**:
Tasks focused on understanding basic and advanced TypeScript concepts, such as:
- Type annotations, interfaces, and unions
- Generics, utility types, and enums

**React with TypeScript**:
Exercises that integrate TypeScript with React, covering:
- Type-safe props and states
- Using TypeScript with hooks and context

 
 ## Repository Structure
 ```.
â”œâ”€â”€ ts-react/    # Practice tasks focusing on TypeScript concepts in React
â”œâ”€â”€ ts/          # A collection of small tasks exploring various TypeScript features
â””â”€â”€ README.md    # You're here!
```

## Folder Descriptions
**`ts/`** Contains a wide range of small tasks targeting individual TypeScript concepts, such as:
- Type annotations and type inference
- Interfaces and type aliases
- Generics and utility types
- Advanced features like mapped and conditional types
**`ts-react/`** Focused tasks that integrate TypeScript with React, covering:
  - Type-safe props and state management
  - Using hooks with TypeScript
  - Creating reusable, type-safe React components
