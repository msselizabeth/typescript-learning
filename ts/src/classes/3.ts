/**
 * You are creating a game where there are characters with different roles.
 * You are currently working on a Wizard class that should implement two interfaces, ICharacter and ISpellCaster.
 * Define the ICharacter and ISpellCaster interfaces so that they meet the requirements of the Wizard class.
 * The ICharacter interface should include properties name and level, as well as methods introduce and levelUp.
 * The ISpellCaster interface should include a method castSpell.
*/

// Solution
interface ICharacter {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  introduce(phrase: string): void;
  levelUp(level: number): void;
}

interface ISpellCaster {
  castSpell(): void;
}
// implementing Wizard class
class Wizard implements ICharacter, ISpellCaster {
  constructor(public name: string, public level: number) {
    if (this.level < 1) {
      throw new Error("Level too low");
    }
  }

  introduce(phrase: string): void {
    console.log(phrase + ", " + this.name);
  }

  castSpell(): void {
    console.log("Casting a spell, behold my power!");
  }

  levelUp(): void {
    this.level++;
    console.log(`Level up! New level is ${this.level}`);
  }
}

// Example usage
const wizard = new Wizard("Merlin", 15);
console.log(wizard);

wizard.introduce("I am the mighty wizard");
wizard.castSpell();
wizard.levelUp(); // Level up! New level is 16
